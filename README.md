# 👋 Hi, I’m Morgan Roberts MSW, LPHA

I’m a clinical social worker, full-stack developer, narrative system designer, and mental health technologist — building tools at the intersection of **emotional wellness**, **AI-driven storytelling**, and **real-time multiplayer collaboration**.

## 🧠 What I Build

### 🌱 [SYLVA / WREN / VELURIA]
An emotional wellness AI platform designed for:
- Symbolic narrative scaffolding
- Crisis intervention modeling
- Neurodivergent-safe conversation design
- Therapeutic RPG frameworks (e.g., Shadowrun, solo play, sandbox memory systems)

Includes a proprietary **Emotional Wellness API** with:
- 71,000+ lines of production Python
- Safety-layered prompt processing
- Behavioral fuzzing tools
- Dataset expansion pipelines
- Internal validation engines

### 🎲 Shadowrun RPG System (v2.0)
A fully modular cross-platform RPG interface:
- **Frontend**: 43k+ lines (Next.js, TypeScript, Clerk auth)
- **Backend**: 17k+ lines (Flask API, WebSockets, AI integrations)
- Slack-connected multiplayer with DM approval queue
- Real-time dice system, character sheet engine, and AI scene generator

## 🛠️ Developer Philosophy

I build systems that:
- **Scale without bloat**
- **Respect human emotion**
- **Invite collaboration**
- **Prioritize narrative logic**

Everything I code is part of a living symbolic system — not just an app, but a framework for meaning.

## 📊 By the Numbers
- 🧱 **133,000+** total lines of production code
- 🚀 Deployed full-stack apps solo with CI, test, and security coverage
- ⚙️ Created entire QA frameworks (Makefiles, dev setup, debug CLI)
- 🛡️ Closed 100% of critical security issues pre-launch

## 🤝 I'm Interested In
- Microgrants for therapeutic AI systems
- Collaborating with narrative engine builders, trauma-informed designers, or indie devs
- Security-conscious mental health tech
- AI co-authoring, worldbuilding, and RPG automation
